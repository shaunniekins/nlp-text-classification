SUPREME COURT

Manila

EN BANC

G.R. No. L-4968 August 3, 1910

SALVADOR LOPEZ, plaintiff-appellant,

vs.

RAFAEL ENRIQUEZ, ET AL., defendant-appellees

Carlos Ledesma and Ramon Fernandez, for appellant.

Hartigan and Rohde for appellees.

MAPA, J.:

It is alleged in the complaint filed in this cause:

First. That, under No. 1869, a case was tried in the Court of First Instance of Manila concerning the testate estate of Antonio Enriquez and the intestate estate of Ciriaca Villanueva.

Second. That in the said estates defendants appear as heirs to the property left by the said spouses at their death.

Third. That the plaintiff held a claim against the said estates amounting to 10,557 francs, or their equivalent in Philippine currency, which was allowed and ordered paid by the court on August 26, 1905.

Fourth. That the administrator of the estates did not immediately pay the said debt, alleging that at the time he did not have the necessary cash, but that he would get the money to liquidate the debt as soon as possible, which up to the present time, he has not done.

Fifth. That on the 2d of January, 1906, the heirs of the spouses Enriquez and Villanueva executed an instrument of partition of property, which appears in the record of the said case No. 1869 and was approved by the court on January 25, 1906; that by virtue of the instrument aforesaid, the proceedings in case No. 1869 above mentioned were concluded without the plaintiff's knowledge.

Sixth. That as a result of the proceedings in the said case, without previous payment to the plaintiff, who is a recognize creditor in the suit, the plaintiff is obliged to file this complaint praying for the rescission of the partition of the property of the deceased spouses Enriquez and Villanueva, unless their heirs give a sufficient and proper bond to secure the payment of his claim.

Seventh. That the plaintiff suffers great detriment by this delay in the payment already authorized by the Court of First Instance, and by having to file the new complaint.

On the grounds hereinbefore related, the plaintiff prays that judgment be rendered against the defendants for the sum of 10,557 francs, or their equivalent in Philippine currency with legal interest thereon, and the costs, and that the partition already made between the heirs be annulled unless they give bond to secure the payment of the amount claimed.

The defendants Francisco Enriquez and Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez denied in their answer, among other alleged facts, that contained in paragraph 3 of the complaint, and alleged expressly that the debt therein claimed was contracted solely and exclusively by their codefendant Rafael Enriquez for the latter's use and exclusive benefit and that such liability was incurred long after the death of their predecessors in interest, Francisco Enriquez and Ciria...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(54%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>plaintiff judgment defendant sum estate court interest property pay complaint</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>case court law appellant made fact evidence presented time appeal</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>land property possession sale owner made instrument sold plaintiffs article</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>court action plaintiff law question judgment cases party order civil</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
