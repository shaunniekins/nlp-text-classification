SUPREME COURT

EN BANC

G.R. No. L-5606 March 2, 1910

THE UNITED STATES, plaintiff-appellee,

vs.

RAMON INSIERTO, defendant-appellant.

Aniceto Reyes, for appellant.

Office of the Solicitor-General Harvey, for appellee.

ARELLANO, C.J.:

The defendant inflicted upon his niece, Marcelina Cainela, a girl of twelve years of age, three wounds, which required a little over a month to cure, without medical attendance, and of which on the day of the trial nothing but the scars appeared. The wounds were: one on the thigh, another near it, and another in the back, and were the result of punishment inflicted with a reaping hook, because she had been unable to answer a question in a lesson that he was giving her.

The Court of First Instance of Cebu, taking into consideration the aggravating circumstance of parentage and in addition that of abuse of person of tender age, sentenced him to two years and four months of prison correctional, with the corresponding accessory penalties, but credited him with one-sum of the time of his detention in prison, and to pay the costs, without subjecting him to pay an indemnity for the reason that no evidence had been adduced as to damages.

Marcelina Cainela declared that she lived with her aunt and uncle, Olivia Insierto and Ramon Insierto, the accused; that the latter was her teacher; that he had been teaching her for a long time and did not beat her when she took lessons, and that he beat her on that occasion only because she had been unable to answer his question.

By his testimony the accused shows that his mental faculties were somewhat unbalanced ever since he suffered from an affection of the head.

The testimony of Olivia Insierto agreed with the statement of her niece, Marcelina Cainela. With respect to the condition of the accused she testified as follows:

FISCAL. Ramon Insierto, the defendant, has testified that in the month of December, 1908 (when the affair happened), he was insane. Is this true? WITNESS. He suffered from that malady after having been wounded. FISCAL. Was he not insane before that? WITNESS. I do not know, but it is true that he was sick. FISCAL. What was nature of his sickness? WITNESS. At first he had pains in the back of the neck and waist.

For the simple reason that when the child Marcelina was asked how many days she had been ill she replied more than one month, the injured inflicted by the accused have been classified as graves. But upon being asked "Who cured you?" she replied: "We, ourselves;" that is to say, no medical attendance was required. And further, it has not been shown whether, as a result, she was unable to attend to her ordinary work.

There is reason to question the classification of wounds as graves, made by the trial court, in view of the doctrine established by the decision in cassation of the 23d of December, 1876, to wit, that "in classifying injuries where the special circumstances of Nos. 1, 2, and 3 of article 431 of the Penal Code are not involved (416 of the Code of the Philippines), the application of the criminal law depends entirely upon the longer or shorter duration of the me...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(49%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>accused crime witness testimony defendant house time testified penal witnesses</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>defendant house deceased found evidence fact left trial de appellant</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>case court law appellant made fact evidence presented time appeal</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>court action plaintiff law question judgment cases party order civil</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>court defendant trial manila accused law opium attorney complaint criminal</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
