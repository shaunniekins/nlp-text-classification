JOHNSON, J.:

This was an action to recover the possession of the three parcels of land, the first situated in "el sitio de Jaimaya," the second in "el sitio de Tabao," and the third in "el sitio de Nabusuang."

After hearing the evidence the lower court found that the plaintiff was the owner and entitled to the possession of the first parcel, or that located in the sitio of Jaimaya, and that the defendant, Pedro Jaboneta, was the owner of the other two parcels of land or those situated in Tabao and Nabusuang.

From that decision the plaintiff appealed to this court.

From the proof adduced during the trial, the following facts are proven:

First. That the parcels of land located in the sitios of Tabao and Nabusuang were, on the 15th day of May, 1899, delivered by their former owner, Ciriaco Monta�ez, to his brother, the plaintiff herein, Higinio Monta�ez, under an alleged mortgage, for the sum of P200. (Exhibit No. 1.)

Second. That the parcel of land situated in the sitio of Jaimaya was delivered by its former, Ciriaco Monta�ez, to Higino Monta�ez, on the 19th day of May, 1899, under a pacto de retro, for the sum of P400. (Exhibit No. 2.)

Third. That the three parcels of land above mentioned were, on the 3d day of August, 1899, sold by the said Ciriaco Monta�es to Pedro Jaboneta, under a pacto de retro, for the sum of P550. (Exhibit A.)

Fourth. That each of the above-mentioned contracts was a private document and none of them were recorded. itc_alf

Fifth. That on the 3d day of August, 1906, the Court of First Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros, in an action then pending between Pedro Jaboneta, as plaintiff, and Ciriaco Monta�ez, as defendant, with reference to the three parcels of land in question, rendered a decision, the dispositive part of which was as follows:
