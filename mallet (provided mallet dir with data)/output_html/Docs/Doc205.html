SUPREME COURT

Manila

EN BANC

G.R. No. L-5785 August 23, 1910

GO TO SUN, by his father and natural guardian, Manuel Nubla Co Siong, petitioner-appellant,

vs.

H. B. MCCOY, Insular Collector of Customs, respondent-appellee.

Claro Reyes Panlilio, for appellant.

Attorney-General Villamor, for appellee.

JOHNSON, J.:

On the 1st of August, 1909, the said Go To Sun, a Chinaman, arrived in the Philippine Islands and asked permission to enter, which permission was denied, by the Collector of Customs, after giving the said applicant an opportunity to present all the witnesses which he had relating to his right to enter the Philippine Islands.

From that decision the plaintiff appealed to this court.

Upon an examination of the record brought here we find no reason for reversing the judgment of the lower court. The plaintiff himself swore that he was 21 years of age and so did his father. Not being a minor, he was not entitled to enter the Philippine Islands simply for the purpose of being under the care and custody of his father. The plaintiff admitted that he had never been in the Philippine Islands before.
