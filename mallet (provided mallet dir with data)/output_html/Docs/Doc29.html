SUPREME COURT

EN BANC

G.R. No. L-2532 November 17, 1910

In re MACARIO ADRIATICO,

W.A. Kincaid, for petitioner.

JOHNSON, J.:

On the 11th day of December, 1906, the petitioner was by this court removed from his office as a lawyer, and the certificate permitting him to practice law therefore issued to him was canceled and annulled, for the reasons set out in the decision. (See in re Adriatico, 7 Phil. Rep., 173.) He now, through his attorney, Mr. W. A.. Kincaid, presents a petition asking for reinstatement.

This petition or motion is not presented by one of the leading members of the Philippine Bar, but the reinstatement of Mr. Adriatico is also urged and recommended by the Philippine Bar Association. 1awphil.net

Mr. Adriatico was elected a member of the First Philippine Assembly, as well as of the Second, from the same Assembly District, the Island of Mindoro. His conduct as a member of the Legislature has merited the approval of both the Hon. W. Cameron Forbes, Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, and Sergio Osmeï¿½a, Speaker of the Philippine Assembly. His good conduct is also certified to by the Hon. Mariano Cui, judge of the Seventh Judicial District.

No objection is made by anyone to the motion which he presents. lawphil.net The petitioner promises that, should he be reinstated by this court, he will, in the future, observe the laws and will, in all respects, act honestly and uprightly.

Considering his conduct since his suspension and considering the power of this court in the premises (In re Boone, 90 Fed. Rep., 793, 83 Fed. Rep., 944; In re Treadwell, 114 Cal., 24; In re King, 54 Ohio State, 415), we are of the opinion, and so hold, that Macario Adriatico may be admitted to the bar of the Philippine Islands upon taking the usual oath. It is so ordered.

Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, Moreland and Trent, JJ., concur.
