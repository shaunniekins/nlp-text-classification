Edward B. Bruce, for appellant.

Attorney-General Villamor, for appellee.

MORELAND, J.:

The defendant in this case was convicted in the Court of First Instance of the Province of La Union of a violation of the Gambling Law. He was sentenced to six months in prison and to pay a fine of P200. From the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed thereunder the defendant appealed to this court.

It appears from the records that the crime for the commission of which the defendant stands convicted was committed in the municipality of San Juan, Province of La Union; that the defendant was arrested by and brought before the justice of the peace of that municipality; that, by reason of the suspension of that justice of the peace from the performance of the duties of his office, the cause was transferred to the justice of the peace of the municipality of San Fernando...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(41%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>court defendant trial manila accused law opium attorney complaint criminal</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>case court law appellant made fact evidence presented time appeal</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>municipal municipality court province provincial pueblo paragraph building board house</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>defendant house deceased found evidence fact left trial de appellant</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>government act united states islands power general state case governor</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
