Thos. D. Aitken, for petitioners.

Charles C. Cohn, for respondent.

This statute recognizes the system of rendering written decision in which are developed the reasoning by which the conclusion are reached. The customs of stating the grounds of a decision in writing is of comparatively recent origin. Under the early English practice, if any reasons were given, they were stated orally by the judges, and taken down by the reporters.
