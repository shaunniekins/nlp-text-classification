SUPREME COURT

Manila

EN BANC

G.R. No. L-5676 March 2, 1910

LIM TIU, LIM SUNTIAN and LIM KAENG JO, operating under the name of "Lim Juco y Compaï¿½ia," plaintiffs-appellants,

vs.

RUIZ Y REMENTERIA, a concern operating under the name of "La Isla de Cuba," defendant-appellee.

Thos. D. Aitken, for appellants.

Sanz & Opisso, for appellee.

JOHNSON, J.:

On the 6th day of July, 1908, the plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, alleging that upon the 26th day of May, 1908, the 5th day of June, 1908, and the 12th day of June, 1908, they sold to the defendant certain merchandise, amounting to the sum of P1,043.57; that said amount was due and unpaid, and prayed judgment for said sum (P1,043.57) with interest and cost.

To this petition the defendants filed a general denial.

After hearing the evidence, the lower court, found as a fact that "the defendants purchased the merchandise in question from Domingo Tim Bun Liu and paid the said Domingo Tim Bun Liu for the merchandise."

The lower court further said: "The conclusions are that the defendants have paid for the merchandise described in the complaint, and that they are not liable for payment for the value thereof," and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiffs and dismissed said complaint, with costs against the plaintiffs.

From this decision of the lower court the plaintiffs appealed and made the following assignments of error:

First. The lower court erred in holding as follows: "It also clearly appears that the defendants purchased the merchandise in question from Domingo Tim Bun Liu and paid Domingo Tim Bun Liu for the merchandise."

Second. The lower court erred in holding that the plaintiffs never notified the defendants, in any way, that their employee, Domingo Tim Bun Liu, could sell their merchandise, but could not receive payment for it, and that the defendants never had notice that their business transactions with Domingo Tim Bun Liu were by him as agent or employee of the plaintiffs.

Third. The court erred in holding that the plaintiffs accepted payment through Domingo Tim Bun Liu.

Fourth. The court erred in holding that "the defendants having in good faith purchased the goods upon an agreement to pay for them in merchandise of their own, under an agreement with the person from whom they received the goods, to so pay for them, could not be held responsible for the failure of the plaintiffs' employee to deliver to his employers, that which was received in payment."

Fifth. The court erred in admitting as evidence Exhibit D (1), Exhibit D (2), and Exhibit D (3).

Sixth. The court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint and in deciding in favor of the defendants.

Upon these assignments of error the plaintiffs and appellants present three questions:

First. Did the defendants purchase directly from the plaintiffs?

Second. If not, did the defendants have sufficient notice of Domingo Tim Bun Liu's relation with the plaintiffs to place them on their guard?

Third. If the last is answered affirmatively, then was the payment by the defendants to Domingo Tim Bun Liu, in something other than cash, binding on the plaintiffs?

With reference to the first question, "Did the defendants purchase directly from the plaintiffs?" there is much conflict in the testimony. The lower court answered this question in the negative. It appears that the defendants had been buying merchandise from Domingo Tim Bun Liu for a period covering several months, and paying for said merchandise in exchange, and from time to time settling their accounts by the defendants paying to the said Dom...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(52%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>plaintiff judgment defendant sum estate court interest property pay complaint</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>court defendant trial manila accused law opium attorney complaint criminal</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>case court law appellant made fact evidence presented time appeal</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>land property possession sale owner made instrument sold plaintiffs article</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
